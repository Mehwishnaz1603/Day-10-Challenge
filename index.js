//Q28: Stages of Life: Write an if-else chain that determines a personâ€™s stage of life.
// Set a value for the variable age, and then:
//â€¢ If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
//â€¢ If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
//â€¢ If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
//â€¢ If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
//â€¢ If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
//â€¢ If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
var age = 18; //// you can let any age which u desir

//Q29: Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements 
//that check for certain fruits in your array.
//â€¢ Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
//â€¢ Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. 
//If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
var favorite_Fruit = ["Mango", "Apple", "Strawberry",];
// Checking for specific fruits in the array with If-else statments
//There are five IF-else list

//Q30: Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'.
//Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they
//log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//â€¢ If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
//â€¢ Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
var userNames = ["Admin", "Sana", "Ayesha", "Tuba", "Neha", "Kainat",];
